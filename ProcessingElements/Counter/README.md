Counter
===

The Counter PE serves as an example for a simple processing element. It takes one argument to specify the number of clock cycles after which the interrupt is raised.

It is written in Bluespec System Verilog and makes use of [BSVTools](https://github.com/esa-tu-darmstadt/BSVTools) and [BlueAXI](https://github.com/esa-tu-darmstadt/BlueAXI).
